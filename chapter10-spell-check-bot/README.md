# Spell Checker Bot

Practical Bot Development - Chapter 10

This bot is a demostration of talking to the Microsoft Bing Spell Check API to automatically fix spell check errors in user input. The bot utilizes middleware to always spell check any incoming text.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. You will need to make sure you create a .env file which has your Bot Id and Bot Password. You will also need a Spell Check V7 API key.

### Installing and Running

Easy. Peasy.

```
npm install
npm start
```

By default, the bot will run on port 3978.
