# Hot Dog or Not Hot Dog Bot

Practical Bot Development - Chapter 10

This bot is a demostration of using Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision Service to determine whether an image is a hot dog or not (ala, Silicon Valley S4E4)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. You will need to make sure you create a .env file which has your Bot Id and Bot Password. You will also need the Computer Vision service endpoint and key. Both can be grabbed from the Azure Poral.

### Installing and Running

Easy. Peasy.

```
npm install
npm start
```

By default, the bot will run on port 3978. Send images to the bot and it will respond whether it found a hot dog or not.
