# Calendar Bot

This bot is a demostration of how we can use the Microsoft Bot Builder SDK and LUIS to create a bot that is able to action on a calendar. Functionality includes add, remove, move appointments, summarize calendar and check availability.

This git repo is:
* chapter-5 - simple LUIS bot, no logic
* chapter-7 - auth + api integration
* chapter-10 - multi language support
* chapter-12 - human handover
* chapter-13 - bot analytics
* master - equivalent to chapter 10

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. You will need to make sure you create a .env file which has your Bot Id, Bot Password, LUIS app id and LUIS subscription key.

### Installing and Running

Easy. Peasy.

```
npm install
npm start
```

By default, the bot will run on port 3978. Download the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator) to test locally.
