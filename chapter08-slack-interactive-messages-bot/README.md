# Slack Integration Sample Bot

Practical Bot Development - Chapter 8

This bot is a demostration of how we can use the Microsoft Bot Builder SDK to create a bot that connects into Slack using the Azure Bot Service. Both simple and multi step workflows are demostrated in the code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. You will need to make sure you create a .env file which has your Bot Id and Bot Password.

### Installing and Running

Easy. Peasy.

```
npm install
npm start
```

By default, the bot will run on port 3978. Follow the steps in Chapter 8 to establish connectivity between the bot and Slack.

Once running, you can type 'simple' to kick off the simple flow and 'order pizza' to kick off the multi step pizza ordering flow.
